# Defenses

This folder contains implementations of defenses (as standalone scripts) in one
of the three frameworks (JAX, PyTorch, TF2) or if it is framework independent 
then this code should go to the generic folder. Each defense should be 
implemented as a script that helps reproduce results reported in the paper 
introducing the defense. The goal is for these scripts to be authoritative ways
to reproduce the defense.
